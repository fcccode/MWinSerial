MWinSerial will print out the serial number of the current windows
machine that you are working on.  It has been tested on 
XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10.   

Note:  The source code has been tested, but the executable in the bin
folder was compiled on a windows 10 64 bit.  So, you may need to 
recompile the code on an older XP machine.


Build Instructions
-------------------

Use NMake to build the windows version of the program.
Switch to the src folder and compile with NMake.
